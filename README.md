# Template Pack

This is a simple "pack" thats more or less a template to save yourself a little bit of time when throwing together a sinkpack or whatnot. 

It comes with the standard performance and qol mods you download pretty much every time already, as well as the following:
* Storage Drawers, Framed Storage Drawers, and a handframing recipe.
* PAE2 with channels disabled by default, and cables and facades being hidden from HEI.
* Chisel
